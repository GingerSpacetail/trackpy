v0.6
----

This release focuses on fixing bugs and some inconsistencies in the prediction
capabilities. Some existing code that used prediction may now fail to run until
a (minor) update is made.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~


API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- When supplying an initial velocity guess to NearestVelocityPredict or
  DriftPredict, you must also supply the pos_columns argument to identify
  the names of the columns in your array. (For example,
  "pos_columns = ['y', 'x']".) Otherwise, creating the predictor will
  raise an exception that explains this change. If you provide pos_columns
  when creating the predictor, you do not have to supply it when subsequently
  using the link_df() or link_df_iter() methods to link your features.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- When linking with prediction, the predictor now correctly uses the same
  position columns as the linker, and correctly handles the pos_columns
  argument if specified.
- The link_df() method of predictor objects now works correctly.
